Hi! I am Soma. I am currently persuing my undergrad in Btech. My areas of interests include learning 
different languages and I am currently working on my skills in programming and learning fundamentals of data structures
and algorithms in C, Java and Python. Apart from programming, I love reading, writing, painting and speaking.
I enjoy working in teams and individually and I am efficient in both.
I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things that change the world which
also explains why I love being a part of different communities where I can learn to improve myself while also
helping others in doing so.
